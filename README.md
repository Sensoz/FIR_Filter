 The purpose is to design, implement and evaluate a finite impulse
 response (FIR) filter by using Matlab, C program and VHDL.
 According to specifications, the filter is 10th order, low pass with 14 bit data and 1
 kHz of cut-off frequency.
 To obtain stated filter, a Matlab code is written to get samples and filter them by
 using multiplication coefficients and obtain output samples. Then a C program
 also written for the same purpose as well as VHDL.
 The final design of the filter is with 3-level unfolding and pipelining, to make the
 design more efficient.
